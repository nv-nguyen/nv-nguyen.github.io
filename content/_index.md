I am a Research Scientist at [United Imaging Intelligence (UII America)](https://www.uii-ai.com/) working on 3D Computer Vision and Robotics in medical environments. 
Before joining UII America, I received my PhD at <a href="http://imagine.enpc.fr/">IMAGINE team</a>, <a href="http://www.enpc.fr/">École des Ponts ParisTech</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://vincentlepetit.github.io/">Prof. Vincent Lepetit</a>.

During my PhD, I interned twice at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/">Meta Reality Labs</a>, worked with <a href="https://thodan.github.io/">Tomas Hodan</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-moulon/">Pierre Moulon</a> in 2022. Prior to that, I graduated from the Master <a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">Mathématiques, Vision and Apprentissage (MVA)</a> from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en">École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay</a> and Engineering Program in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/">INSA Toulouse</a>. I also had chance to spend time at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/">EPFL</a>, <a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html">SIEMENS</a>.
