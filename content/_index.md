I am a Research Scientist at [United Imaging Intelligence (UII America)](https://www.uii-ai.com/) working on 3D Computer Vision and Robotics in medical environments. 
Before joining UII America, I received my PhD at [IMAGINE team](http://imagine.enpc.fr/), [École des Ponts ParisTech](http://www.enpc.fr/), under the supervision of [Prof. Vincent Lepetit](https://vincentlepetit.github.io/).

During my PhD, I interned twice at [Meta Reality Lab](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/), worked with [Tomas Hodan](https://thodan.github.io/) in 2024, and [Pierre Moulon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-moulon/) in 2022. Prior to that, I graduated from the Master [Mathématiques, Vision and Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and Engineering Program in Applied Mathematics at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/). I also had chance to spend time at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/), [SIEMENS](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html).
